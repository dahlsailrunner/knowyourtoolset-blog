Putting a silver color background on your comments is a quick and easy productivity booster for me.  It may seem subtle but I’ve found it way easier to visually recognize comments with the silver background than if I just leave it white.  I do this both within Visual Studio *and* SQL Server Management Studio for SQL statements and procs.

Here are the benefits I get from doing this:

* It’s ridiculously easy for me to ignore comments if I’m trying to see and understand the code that is actually “in play”
* I can easily single out comments and review them if I choose to do so

To do this for yourself, it’s a simple Options change to VS / SSMS (Tools->Options in both places) — just change the Item background setting for Comment:
