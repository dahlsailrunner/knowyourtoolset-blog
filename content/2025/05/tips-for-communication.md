The importance of effective, clear communication is just as important
now as it's ever been.  This article will give you some concrete tips
and suggestions that ensure your content maximizes both its efficiency
and effectiveness.

{{% notice info "Can't AI Just Do it For Me?" %}}
Yes, AI can create content for you - and you can even
include some of these tips in the prompt you use to request the content.
But the content you create **is coming from YOU,** so it still reflects ***your***
ability to create a clear message.

## What Types of Communication Apply?

The list below is almost certainly not exhaustive, but it covers many of the
communication formats that I create most often:

* Emails
* Blog posts
* LinkedIn posts (could also apply to X / BlueSky / Mastodon)
* Teams / Slack
* Official business memos
* Executive summaries
* Power Point presentations
* Wiki pages / Notion docs / Loops
* Readme's

## 1: Know Your Audience

First, identify the target of your communication.  Then, think about what you
have in common - and not - with the target.  Here are some questions that might
help in this process:

* Do they do the exact same job as me?
* Is it in the same precise business domain?
* Is their experience level the same as mine?

Additionally, time considerations can matter:

* Should the content be relevant a year from now?  More?

Your communication should not be about showing how much you know, but what
you want your audience to get out of it, or the action you want them to take.
They often don't know your job or your business.  

## 2: Use Bullets and Formatting

Reading a long narrative or paragraph is challenging.  Giving readers a quick
set of key points helps them digest content quickly.

* Make it easy
* Keep bullets simple
* **Use formatting to call attention to key points**

## 3: Less is More

Once you've created the content, I strongly recommend going back through
it and eliminating words and paragraphs that are not needed.

{{% notice info Example %}}
Consider the following example of potential hyperlinks:

* **Click here** to do something interesting
* **Click here** to do something else

That list could be easily simplified:

* **Do something interesting**
* **Do something else**

Notice that the "link" is actually telling them what they can do in the latter
example, where in the first list they need to keep reading to understand what's
behind the links.  

Depending on the actual situation, the words could potentially be
simplified even more.

## 4: Avoid Inside Jokes

The wider your audience gets, the less likely it is that everyone will understand
any humor you include in your communication.

Before including slang, humor, jokes, or similar content, consider whether that
content is equally understandable by everyone that may read it.  Having content
that some don't understand often will mean that the rest of your message is also
more poorly understood.

Keeping a playful tone :smile: is still possible, just be careful of insider content
that only a few would understand.

## 5: Minimize Assumptions

Assumptions can often come in the form of TLAs (Three Letter Acronyms) and if
you were thrown a bit by my initial use of "TLAs" - that was intentional and
an example of exactly the kind of assumption that can throw readers for a
loop and distract from your message.

Having a clear understanding of your audience and what they may or may not
know can help.  Using an acronym may be fine in cases where you are certain
that everyone already knows it.

## 6: Use Visuals Effectively

*A picture is worth a thousand words* is something to keep in mind.  Flows
or relationships or architectures can be represented succinctly with a diagram.

A code sample is another example of a good visual - but keep in mind that
if you're using some "real" code as the sample, it may have extra lines
that are not needed in your example and should be removed -- even if you
do something like the comment in the example below:

```csharp
public void SomeMethod()
{
  // content goes here
}
```

## 7: Summarize Up Front

A common shorthand in the tech world is `tl;dr` - which means *too long; didn't read.*
At the top of many of my blog posts I'll include a `tl;dr` note - which summarizes the
entire post.  

A quick summary can help the reader understand whether they SHOULD keep reading,
since it encapsulates all of the content in a short blurb.  If the blurb is interesting
or applies to them, they can keep reading and get into the details.

**Summarizing is especially important if you're requesting action or making a recommendation.**

In cases where you're requesting action or making a recommendation, get to the point
immediately (and use formatting), as in the following examples that might be at the top
or front of a communication:

* ***Please create report and return by next Tuesday***
* ***Recommend using vendor A***

You can elaborate on both requests and recommendations, but making your point
up front eliminates confusion quickly.

## 8: Avoid Metaphors

Metaphors are a bit like humor: they can distract from the real message you're
trying to get across. Often times they are not well understood on their own
and the thing you're trying to represent is now dependent on the metaphor.

Clear definitions are super important and probably imply that some kind of
"reference" or "key" get included on your communication if you intend to refer
to the metaphor more than once.

An example of this might be some up-front project activities:

* Get a list of tasks with their priorities
* Identify dependencies
* Identify people to work them
* Create a work sequence

The above might be referred to metaphorically as "prime the pump."  Some people
will not know what "prime the pump" even means, let alone be able to associate
that to the initial activities of the project.  Even if you call the activities
above "phase 1" that still may need a reference key to clearly call out exactly
what you mean by that (in more than one place, potentially).

## 10: In Messaging, Avoid "Hi"

As a final "bonus tip," I suggest not starting a new message communication with a
single message like:

> Hi, Erik

This frustrating message is all-too-common, and doesn't really help. No response
is called for and I have no idea what you might be talking about. This is especially
jarring if I'm concentrating on something and now need to think about who the sender
is and what they might want.

A much better approach might be:

> Hi, Erik - need your help with an invoice we received...

At this point I even can help assess priority based on the additional context of
the message and choose to deal with immediately or respond later when I'm not
busy.

## 11: Do Important Communications in Two Stages

When crafting an important communication, create a first draft
and then do one of two things - or both:

* Come back to it later (best is the next day, after a night's sleep)
* Ask for feedback from people you trust

I did both of the above when writing this post. :wink:

Often times a fresh perspective and a second set of eyes can
help you refine your message or avoid a problematic phrase.

Happy Communicating!  :smile:
